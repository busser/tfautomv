## 🔀 Cross-module moves

Move resources across modules and use `tfautomv` to generate the necessary `state mv` commands:

```bash
tfautomv workdir-A workdir-B workdir-C | sh
```

## ⏭️ New feature: skip the `init` and `refresh` steps

Save some time by skipping the `init` and `refresh` phases when computing Terraform's plan:

```bash
tfautomv --skip-init --skip-refresh
# or, for short
tfautomv -sS
```

## 🔊 Granular verbosity

Inspect `tfautomv`'s analysis with any level of detail:

```bash
tfautomv -v
tfautomv -vv
tfautomv -vvv
```

This replaces the previous `-show-analysis` flag.

## 🧠 Core engine rewrite

The internal logic engine has been entirely rewritten. It can now be imported by other tools and has much better tests.

## 📚 Documentation moved to README

The project's documentation, previously found at https://tfautomv.dev, is now in the repository's README. The website now redirects to the repository.
