## 🐛 Bugfix: always append a new line to generated moved blocks

As reported by @untcha in issue #81, when `tfautomv` wrote `moved` blocks to a file it didn't finish with a new-line character. When running `tfautomv` multiple times, generating blocks each time, the resulting code was invalid. This is now fixed.
