## 🐛 Bugfix: respect `--terraform-bin` flag in output

As reported by @p1gmale0n and @strowi in issue #70, `tfautomv` would ignore the `--terraform-bin` flag when generating `<something> state mv` commands. Instead of using the user-provided executable in these commands, it would always use `terraform`. This is now fixed.
